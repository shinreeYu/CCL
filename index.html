                <p>TeamSY, 2106.04.26</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>'The Endless Tree' has long been widely recognized as in the family of Adansonia ever since its existence due to similar appearance. However, there have always been debates because of the very different habits of the Endless Tree and Adansonia. This question may soon be solved concerning that the new technology break may enable people to actually land in one of the galaxies that the Endless Tree may live on and very likely to collect the Endless Tree back (although of course we don't want them to grow here!) </p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Any random galaxy that they happen to come to (luckily, they haven't come to any place near the Earth)</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The endless trees usually have brown seeds and its branches is slightly lighter than the seeds in color, with its leave in outstanding green (surprising it took us so long to find them). The branches typically grows for 1 month and then stop, with its leave growing forever (now we can control this a little bit with laser), eventually making the planet it grows on exhausted and exploded.</p>

                The endless trees are the very first species known that can grow forever, which may include secretes of eternity. However, everything we know so far are just these 'mays' considering we can only observe them from distance (a very loooooooong distance!)

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
                So far we just interact with them using lasers, and with this we gradually learned to stimulate them to grow; stop them from continuously growing leaves; and the latest outbreak is to control the growth of leave!After all, We're trying every effort to go further, but everything is still in process.
